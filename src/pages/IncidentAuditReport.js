            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">ZURI PLACE</h2>
            <p>Ottoman is committed to providing exceptional security services by delivering personalized, high-quality, and cost-efficient solutions to meet the needs of our clients.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>We have been the security service provider to your institution for a long period of time, during this time we have had unknown demands to either withdraw specific guards or transfer them. Most of the demands have always been rejected and questioned since the origin is unknown and can neither be trusted nor verified. This dates back to immediately the hotel stated the operation. In our post Morten analysis of the recent incident, it emerged that unknown people must be trying to create security lapse to their advantage with a target of stealing from Zuri. For them to succeed they are trying to put security provider Ottoman management and Zuri management into misunderstanding that specific guards mishandle guests. Unknown guests goes ahead to request if those guards can be fired.It also emerged that there are syndicate who has mastered the hotel operations very well, they seem to know too much that they should not be aware of considering Zuri should be autonomous in management and operations. Some of them masquerade as DCI,MILITARY OFFICERS, TOUR &GUIDE AGENTS</p>
            <p>As security service provider most criminals target high end hotels at their point of inception into business knowing that that is the point when most management operations are not yet fully put in place. In consideration of the above and recent incident we carried out a security risk assessment with an aim of advising the management on specific measures to boost the security of Zuri. Onto the recent incident where theft emerged from our staff we can report that we managed to put our intelligence wing into action, we managed to arrest the perpetrator and made sure recoveries were done swiftly.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1 INTRUDER ALARM SYSTEM</h3>
         
            <p>There is need for panic intruder alarm that can be used in case of an emergency. A button can be put at the reception for quick use in case he senses danger. This should be treated with urgency it deserves.</p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2 POS BACK UP</h3>
         
         <p>There is need to have full control of the POS system, it seems that some outsiders have internal crucial information regarding guests check in, check out and duration of stay. With this they are likely to even know the financial flow and even know how much cash receptionist has received in a day or night. Outsiders having access to such information is very dangerous since such information can be used negatively against the hotel and to plan an attack to the reception.</p>
         <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3 CCTV MONITOR</h3>
         
         <p>Cctv system is a very important security apparatus but in most cases used wrongly, we should not rely on the footage when an incident has happened. In security there are proactive/prevention measures and reactive/post incident measures. Strictly using CCTv to review incidents puts as to reactive and monitoring the CCtv always is proactive. I would recommend the monitor to be in a place where the receptionist can be viewing it continuous such that suspicious activities can be noted and an alarm be raised promptly. Treat this information from the security expert perspective and not vendor perspective.</p>
         <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5 GUARD AT NIGHT</h3>
         
         <p>There is much exposure and security risk at night considering the value of investment put in place. To secure the place effectively at night 3 guards are needed. Again if you compare the strength of guards needed during the day can not be matched with strength needed at night. The 3rd guard I would recommend we add 1 more guard to the four already existing to make the number 5. Normally where there is bank and accommodation in the same building the area attracts high tech organized criminals. Again relying that Bank also has a guard and counting him to be part of our security strength is a weakness. The 3rd guard can also be used as bouncer at the bar during bar peak hours. Again in an organized crime, two guards can easily be overpowered should there be an attack. The issue of the 3rd guard at night dates back at the inception of the hotel, I had requested to use 3 guards at night. Kindly treat this information with urgency it deserves.</p>

         <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. DVR MACHINES</h3>
        <p>The machine is the most important component in CCTV system, its safety matters a lot since itâ€™s the one that has back up data. I would recommend the outside DVR at the generator house to be put up inside where it's not visible. Relating to the recent incident where the individual had easy access to the device.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. COLOUR VU CAMERAS</h3>
        <p>Colour VU cameras are night vision; they capture day and night the same. These cameras are very much effective in identifying an individual with the body physic and colours of the clothes put on. Normal cameras require a lighting system to capture colours and body physics effectively in darkness and in most cases, the footages will be blurred. Colour Vu footages are easily admissible in courts because of the clarity nature. Kindly treat this information from the perspective of a security expert and not a vendor perspective.</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">8. EXIT/ENTRY POINT BEHIND THE GENERATOR</h3>
        <p>With the position of the sentry box, the exit/entry point is at the back. This poses a security lapse should the criminals decide to use it to access the building. I would advise it be locked completely using brick and mortar, to completely seal the point.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">9. FRONT WALL HAVING AIR CONDITIONERS ON THE DTB SIDE</h3>
        <p>The wall is too low considering the costs and location of the conditioners. Again considering the roof of the outside building. There is a need to build the wall up to a height that hardens the target from outside considering the height of the outside building roof. Air conditioning infrastructure is very expensive and can easily be targeted. The demand for air conditioners is also high in the black market, giving a task to highly protect them and harden their target.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">10. ELECTRIC FENCE WITH RAZOR WIRE</h3>
        <p>There is a need to put an electric fence with razor wire on the grills round, this will hinder intruders who would want to gain access via the fence. The area is approximately 85m, we can give a quotation for the same if requested.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">11. WALL BESIDES THE TRANSFORMER</h3>
        <p>Being at the corner on the side of the road, the height of that wall is low, an intruder can easily use it to gain unauthorized access. Using brick and mortar the height should be adjusted. On the same, there is a mabati fence on the staff quarters running across to this wall. I would recommend the mabati wall be brought down to make the area clear.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">12. INTERNET THURAYA DISH</h3>
        <p>The current one is located at the far corner on top of the DTB ground floor, an outsider can easily it from the roof of the neighboring building. I would recommend that the dish be transferred to the middle pillar where an outsider must make serious efforts to reach it.</p>
